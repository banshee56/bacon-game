Best/Worst Bacons Analysis

I would say Robert De Niro is a better Bacon than Kevin Bacon himself and others.
He has the largest degree and the second smallest average separation.

On the other hand, I would say Sara Allgood would be a bad Bacon because she has the largest average separation
in the Kevin Bacon universe (where Bacon is the center).
She also has a very low degree of just 3.

In summary, I think De Niro would be the best Bacon while Allgood would be a bad Bacon, both in terms of separation and degree.
